## Homework 3:

I've included the python code itself in the file HW3code.py. 

The solutions are presented along with the code in a jupyter notebook file (HW3.ipynb) but not all equations seem to be showing up correctly, so I have also uploaded a pdf version of the jupyter notebook which seems to be correct. 

I'm new at jupyter notebook and not sure why it isn't showing the same thing when on my computer and when uploaded to github!
