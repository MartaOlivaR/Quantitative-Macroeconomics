# QUANTITATIVE MACROECONOMICS: FINAL PROJECT
The pdf file contains my answers to the project, while finalprojectOliva.m and finalprojectOlivaComplex.m are the codes to answer the first and second questions on the project, respectively.

The folder Additional functions contains some Matlab functions which were provided during the course and are needed for the code I wrote to be able to run.
